Please complete Assessment [GH5] 'To-Do List' prepared by Leon Cooper: This challenge is designed to test your react skills in making components, mapping data out, managing your state and receiving user input.

You need to create a To-Do List application that has the following features:

• Add items to the list
• Check items as done
• Delete individual items from the list

You also need to test for the following


• tasks submitted are displayed
• submission button adds task (fireEvent)
• deletion of an item removed the element so it is no longer displayed to the user



Visually this project is completely down to your choice. Get creative and have a look around at existing to-do list applications and designs

Stretch goals
• Be able to edit items in the list
• Archive items from the main list into a secondary list
